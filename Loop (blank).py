#The While Loop means that “while (blank) is occurring, do (blank).”

import time

counter = 1
while counter < 11:
    print (counter)
    time.sleep(.5)
    time.sleep (.5)

#run this code. 

#Now delete the “counter = counter + 1” and run the code. As you can see, without exact instructions, the loop will continue on forever, and we do not want to get stuck in an infinite loop!You can stop it by exiting the program.
